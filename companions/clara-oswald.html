				<h1>Clara Oswald </h1>
				<p>Clara Oswald is a fictional character portrayed by Jenna-Louise Coleman in the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who. First appearing in the show's seventh series, Clara is introduced as a companion of the eleventh incarnation of the alien time traveller known as the Doctor (portrayed by Matt Smith).<br>
					</p>
				<p>Clara is presented to the audience as during the first half of the seventh series as three distinct though similarly named people living in distant eras of time. The first two incarnations each die during the episode in which they appear, while the third becomes the Doctor's full-time companion, travelling with him for the remainder of the series as he tries to uncover the mystery of her multiple lives. Coleman is expected to stay in the role for at least another series, alongside the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi).</p>
